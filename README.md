# Tome
A notebook and wiki app built for how you think.

Almost all existing apps have a forced taxonomy, placing arbitrary boundaries between hierarchical levels that inhibit free-form note-taking. Tome tries to solve this problem with a simple but powerful tree structure and quick cross-referencing tools to build a full network that mirrors your brain.
