# Tome
A notebook and wiki app built for how you think.

Almost all existing apps have a forced taxonomy, placing arbitrary boundaries between hierarchical levels that inhibit free-form note-taking. Tome tries to solve this problem with a simple but powerful tree structure and quick cross-referencing tools to build a full network that mirrors your brain.

## Features
- ~~Flexible hierarchical structure to model how your memory works~~ **coming soon!**
- ~~Item references for rapid information mapping~~ **coming soon!**
- ~~Many item types to save all sorts of things (images, links, passwords, files...)~~ **coming soon!**
- ~~Multiple workspaces to separate your work, study, and home life~~ **coming soon!**
- Responsive and customisable web interface with keyboard shortcuts
- ~~Edit history on all items for auditing and revision control~~ **coming soon!**
- ~~Fine-grained permissions for advanced identity and access management~~ **coming soon!**
- ~~Modern security features like multi-factor authentication and end-to-end encryption~~ **coming soon!**
- ~~Advanced RESTful API for automation~~ **coming soon!**
- Easily self-hostable with Docker Compose so your data stay in your control
- ~~Scalable from tiny single-user home installations to massive enterprise deployments~~ **nope**
